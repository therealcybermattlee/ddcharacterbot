   - **Verified**: Hexblade Warlock (levels 1, 6, 10, 14) confirmed working in production API
9. ✅ Fix Ability Score Assignment Bug in Character Wizard
   - **User Report**: Ability scores not registering when assigned to abilities in Standard Array interface
   - **Symptoms**: UI showed "you have all six abilities to have scores assigned to" even after assignments
   - **Investigation**: Located bug in StandardArrayInterface.tsx `assignScore` function (line 79)
   - **Root Cause**: Incorrect guard condition `!availableScores.includes(score) && !assignments[ability]`
     * Was blocking valid assignments when score was available AND ability had no prior assignment
     * Logic was inverted - prevented assignments instead of allowing them
   - **Fix**: Corrected guard condition to `!availableScores.includes(score) && assignments[ability] !== score`
     * Now properly allows assignments when score is in available pool
     * Only blocks when score is unavailable AND ability doesn't have that exact score
   - **Files Changed**: `/frontend/src/components/character-creation/StandardArrayInterface.tsx`
   - **Impact**:
     * Users can now successfully assign scores from standard array to abilities
     * "Assigned X/6" counter updates correctly
     * Both drag-and-drop and click-to-assign work as intended
   - **Deployment**: Successfully deployed to production (commit a23c943)
   - **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Ability score assignment now functional in Standard Array interface
10. ✅ Implement Subclass Selection in Character Wizard
   - **User Request**: Enable subclass selection when characters reach appropriate level (1 for Cleric/Warlock, 2 for Wizard, 3 for all other classes)
   - **Investigation**: No subclass selection existed in character wizard - BasicInfoStep had no subclass field
   - **Analysis**: Evaluated 5 implementation options, selected Option 1 (Inline in BasicInfoStep) with 95% confidence
   - **Implementation**:
     * Created `SubclassSelector` component with search, filtering, and feature display (163 lines)
     * Added `subclass` and `subclassData` fields to CharacterCreationData type
     * Created `getSubclassLevel()` helper function for class-specific requirements
     * Updated `BasicInfoSchema` with conditional validation using `.refine()`
     * Integrated subclass selection into BasicInfoStep with progressive disclosure
     * Added dynamic step indicator that shows/hides subclass step based on level
   - **Files Created**:
     * `/frontend/src/components/character-creation/SubclassSelector.tsx`
   - **Files Modified**:
     * `/frontend/src/components/wizard/steps/BasicInfoStep.tsx` - Added subclass selection step
     * `/frontend/src/types/dnd5e.ts` - Added Subclass interface
     * `/frontend/src/types/wizard.ts` - Added getSubclassLevel(), subclass fields, validation
   - **Features**:
     * Progressive disclosure - only shows when level requirement met
     * Dynamic step count (5 steps for level 1-2, 6 steps for level 3+)
     * Search and filter subclasses by name/description
     * Display available features at current character level
     * Subclass info included in character summary
   - **Deployment**: Successfully deployed to production (commit 103f180)
   - **Testing**: ✅ **VALIDATED** - Wizard correctly shows 6 steps for level 3 Fighter, 5 steps for level 1
   - **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Subclass selection fully integrated with level-based progressive disclosure
11. ✅ Implement Comprehensive Feat Selection System
   - **User Request**: Enable feat selection for backgrounds that grant feat choices (2024 D&D rules)
   - **Investigation**: No feat system existed - analyzed 5 implementation options
   - **Solution**: Frontend-only feat data storage matching spell/equipment pattern
   - **Implementation**:
     * Created `/frontend/src/data/feats.ts` with 56 D&D 5e feats (1,092 lines)
     * Created `FeatSelector` component with search, filtering, and prerequisite checking (269 lines)
     * Added `featChoices?: string[]` to Background interface (2024 D&D support)
     * Added `selectedFeat` and `selectedFeatData` to CharacterCreationData type
     * Integrated feat selection into BasicInfoStep with progressive disclosure
     * Dynamic step count adjusts based on feat availability
   - **Files Created**:
     * `/frontend/src/data/feats.ts` - Comprehensive feat database
     * `/frontend/src/components/character-creation/FeatSelector.tsx` - Feat selection UI
   - **Files Modified**:
     * `/api/src/types.ts` - Added featChoices to Background interface
     * `/frontend/src/types/wizard.ts` - Added feat fields to CharacterCreationData
     * `/frontend/src/components/wizard/steps/BasicInfoStep.tsx` - Integrated feat selection step
   - **Features**:
     * 56 complete feat implementations (PHB, XGE, TCE)
     * Categories: Combat (24), Spellcasting (8), Utility (12), Racial (7), Mobility (3), Social (2)
     * Prerequisite system: ability scores, proficiency, spellcasting, race, level
     * Ability score increase tracking and display
     * Search and category filtering
     * Progressive disclosure - only shows when background offers feat choices
     * 9 helper functions: getAllFeats(), getFeatsByCategory(), searchFeats(), meetsPrerequisites(), getAvailableFeats(), etc.
   - **Bundle Size**: ~47KB raw feat data, ~12-15KB gzipped (minimal impact)
   - **Deployment**: Successfully deployed to production (commit 4160afe)
   - **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Feat selection fully integrated with background-based progressive disclosure
12. ✅ Expand Feat Database with Missing Official Content
   - **User Request**: Add missing feats from official D&D 5e sourcebooks
   - **Investigation**: Discovered 14 missing feats across 3 sourcebooks
   - **Research**: Conducted comprehensive web research to gather feat mechanics and descriptions
   - **Implementation**:
     * Added 7 missing XGE racial feats: Bountiful Luck, Drow High Magic, Fey Teleportation, Infernal Constitution, Prodigy, Squat Nimbleness, Wood Elf Magic
     * Added 4 missing TCE feats: Artificer Initiate, Eldritch Adept, Metamagic Adept, Skill Expert
     * Added 3 Fizban's Treasury of Dragons feats: Gift of the Chromatic Dragon, Gift of the Gem Dragon, Gift of the Metallic Dragon

   - **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Feat database now includes all major official 5e sourcebook feats (PHB, XGE, TCE, FTD)
13. ✅ Implement Dynamic Weapon Selector for Starting Equipment
   - **User Request**: Enable selection of "any martial weapon" / "any simple weapon" instead of limited preset options
   - **Problem**: Fighter starting equipment only offered 2-3 preset weapon choices instead of full weapon proficiency
   - **Investigation**: Equipment system used `EquipmentItem[][]` with fixed options - no dynamic weapon selection
   - **Solution**: Created comprehensive weapon database and dynamic weapon selector component
   - **Implementation**:
     * Created `/frontend/src/data/weapons.ts` with all 37 D&D 5e weapons (489 lines)
       - 10 simple melee weapons (Club, Dagger, Greatclub, Handaxe, Javelin, Light Hammer, Mace, Quarterstaff, Sickle, Spear)
       - 4 simple ranged weapons (Light Crossbow, Dart, Shortbow, Sling)
       - 18 martial melee weapons (Battleaxe, Flail, Glaive, Greataxe, Greatsword, Halberd, Lance, Longsword, Maul, Morningstar, Pike, Rapier, Scimitar, Shortsword, Trident, War Pick, Warhammer, Whip)
       - 5 martial ranged weapons (Blowgun, Hand Crossbow, Heavy Crossbow, Longbow, Net)
       - Complete weapon properties: damage, damage type, weight, cost (in copper), properties (ammunition, finesse, heavy, light, loading, reach, special, thrown, two-handed, versatile)
     * Created `WeaponSelector` interface in `startingEquipment.ts`:
       - `category: 'simple' | 'martial'` - weapon proficiency level
       - `type?: 'melee' | 'ranged'` - optional filter for melee or ranged only
       - `count: number` - how many weapons to select
       - `includeShield?: boolean` - enables either/or logic (e.g., "1 weapon + shield OR 2 weapons")
     * Created `/frontend/src/components/wizard/WeaponSelector.tsx` component (219 lines):
       - Dynamic weapon list filtered by category and type
       - Either/or logic: if `includeShield` option exists, user chooses shield + fewer weapons OR no shield + more weapons
       - Selection limits enforced: maxWeapons = includeShield && !shieldSelected ? count * 2 : count
       - Visual feedback: selected weapons highlighted, disabled weapons grayed out
       - Weapon details displayed: name, damage, damage type, properties
     * Updated Fighter equipment in `startingEquipment.ts`:
       - Changed from fixed weapon options to `weaponSelector: { category: 'martial', count: 1, includeShield: true }`
       - Enables Fighter to choose ANY martial weapon + shield OR 2 martial weapons
     * Updated `EquipmentSpellsStep.tsx` to conditionally render weapon selector vs. standard equipment choice
   - **Files Created**:
     * `/frontend/src/data/weapons.ts` - Complete D&D 5e weapons database
     * `/frontend/src/components/wizard/WeaponSelector.tsx` - Dynamic weapon selection UI
   - **Files Modified**:
     * `/frontend/src/data/startingEquipment.ts` - Added WeaponSelector interface, updated Fighter equipment
     * `/frontend/src/components/wizard/steps/EquipmentSpellsStep.tsx` - Added weapon selector rendering logic
   - **Features**:
     * All 37 PHB weapons with accurate damage, properties, weight, and cost
     * Helper functions: `getWeaponById()`, `getWeaponsByCategory()`, `getWeaponsByType()`, `formatWeaponProperties()`
     * Weapon-to-EquipmentItem conversion for seamless equipment list integration
     * Selection counter badge showing X/Y selected
     * Support for complex equipment choices like "1 weapon + shield OR 2 weapons"
   - **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Weapon selector system fully functional and accessible
   - **Deployment**: Successfully deployed to production (commit 78430ed)
14. ✅ Fix Skills Step Validation Bug (Bug #12)
   - **User Request**: Fix bug preventing navigation from Skills step to Equipment step
   - **Symptoms**:
     * Skills step shows "2/2 selected" in UI but validation still fails
     * Selected class skills (Acrobatics, Perception) visible in UI with checkmarks
     * localStorage only contains background skills (Athletics, Intimidation), missing class skills
     * Next button remains disabled despite UI showing correct selection
   - **Investigation**:
     * `selectedClassSkills` React state is correct but not persisted to `characterData.skills`
     * Traced data flow from component → onChange → context → localStorage
     * Identified race condition in CharacterCreationContext.tsx
   - **Root Cause**: Race condition in `updateStepData()` function (lines 232-235)
     * `saveProgress()` called synchronously immediately after `dispatch({ type: 'UPDATE_STEP_DATA' })`
     * React state updates are asynchronous - reducer hadn't updated `state.characterData` yet
     * Old data (without class skills) saved to localStorage before new data applied
     * This affected ALL wizard steps, not just Skills step
   - **Fix**:
     * Removed synchronous `saveProgress()` call from `updateStepData()` function
     * Added `useEffect` hook (lines 372-376) that watches `state.characterData`
     * Auto-saves to localStorage AFTER reducer has updated the state
     * Ensures data persistence happens at correct time in React lifecycle
   - **Files Modified**:
     * `/frontend/src/contexts/CharacterCreationContext.tsx` (lines 232-235, 372-376)
   - **Impact**:
     * All character data now persists correctly to localStorage
     * Skills step validation works as expected
     * Users can navigate to Equipment & Spells step
     * Weapon selector feature now accessible
   - **Deployment**: Successfully deployed to production (commit 78430ed)
   - **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Race condition fixed, all wizard steps now save data correctly
15. ✅ Enhance Visual Design with D&D Fantasy Theme
   - **User Request**: "Could you make the site more visually appealing?"
   - **Investigation**:
     * Reviewed existing design (index.css, tailwind.config.js)
     * Found D&D color palette (dnd-*, magic-*, spell-*) and Cinzel font already configured
     * Identified underutilization of fantasy theming on homepage and navigation
   - **Implementation**:
     * **Home.tsx** - Complete redesign (lines 1-128):
       - Added fantasy-themed hero section with gradient background (dnd-700 → dnd-600 → magic-700)
       - Implemented decorative elements: animated sparkles (3 positions), grid pattern SVG overlay
       - Updated copy to fantasy language: "Forge legendary heroes", "Begin Your Quest", "View Party"

       - Enhanced navigation bar with gradient (white → magic-50/30), shadow-lg, border-b-2
       - Applied gradient text to site title (dnd-700 → magic-700) with Cinzel font
       - Updated active state: dnd-600 border, dnd-700 text, font-semibold
       - Updated hover state: magic-300 border, magic-700 text
       - Added smooth transitions (duration-200) to all navigation items
   - **Files Modified**:
     * `/frontend/src/components/Home.tsx` (complete redesign, 128 lines)
     * `/frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx` (navigation enhancement, 56 lines)
   - **Design Elements**:
     * Color palette: D&D red (#f56565), Magic purple/blue (#6366f1), Spell blue (#3b82f6), Amber accents
     * Typography: Cinzel serif font for headings, existing body font maintained

16. ✅ Add Login/Logout Functionality to Navigation
   - **User Request**: "Could you make a function to log in?"
   - **Investigation**:
     * Discovered complete authentication system already implemented
     * Backend: JWT-based auth in `/api/src/routes/auth.ts` with register, login, logout, profile, refresh endpoints
     * Frontend: AuthContext in `/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` with login/register/logout functions
     * Modal: LoginModal component in `/frontend/src/components/auth/LoginModal.tsx` for UI
     * System: AuthProvider already wired up in main.tsx wrapping entire app
   - **Implementation**:
     * Added login/logout UI to Layout.tsx navigation (lines 1-99):
       - Imported useAuth hook, LoginModal component, UserCircleIcon, ArrowRightOnRectangleIcon
       - Added useState for login modal visibility
       - Created auth section in navigation bar (right side)
       - Unauthenticated state: Gradient login button (dnd-600 → magic-600) with UserCircleIcon
       - Authenticated state: User profile display (username + icon) and logout button
       - Integrated LoginModal with fantasy-themed messaging ("Welcome Back, Adventurer")
   - **Files Modified**:
     * `/frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx` (added 43 lines, total 99 lines)
