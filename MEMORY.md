# Project Memory - D&D Character Manager

## Current Session Context (2025-10-11)

### Authentication & Deployment Status
- ✅ Wrangler authentication completed (john@leefamilysso.com)
- ✅ Cloudflare accounts available: CyberMattLee, LLC & personal account
- ✅ Project ready for deployment to Cloudflare Workers/Pages

### Configuration Updates
- ✅ CLAUDE.md enhanced with mandatory agent usage policy
- ✅ Comprehensive Wrangler command reference added
- ✅ Project memory management system established

### Project Structure Overview
- **Frontend**: `/frontend/` - React + TypeScript + Vite
- **API**: `/api/` - Cloudflare Workers + Hono + TypeScript
- **Database**: D1 SQLite with migrations in `/database/`
- **Infrastructure**: Cloudflare Pages + Workers deployment

### Development Environment
- **Production-only development policy** enforced
- Frontend URL: https://dnd.cyberlees.dev
- API URL: https://dnd-character-manager-api-dev.cybermattlee-llc.workers.dev/api
- Local development servers prohibited per CLAUDE.md

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Agent Usage**: Mandatory specialized agent usage for all applicable tasks
2. **Memory System**: Project memory tracking implemented for session continuity
3. **Wrangler Integration**: Complete command reference documented for deployment operations
4. **Security**: JWT secrets to be managed via Wrangler secrets (not in config files)

   - **Status**: ✅ **VALIDATED** - Deployment pipeline now successful
7. ✅ Implement Comprehensive Starting Equipment System
   - **User Request**: Enable starting equipment selection functionality for character creation
   - **Investigation**: Found equipment system only supported 4/12 D&D classes (Fighter, Wizard, Cleric, Rogue)
   - **Solution**: Created comprehensive starting equipment data for all 12 D&D classes
   - **Files Created**: `/frontend/src/data/startingEquipment.ts` with complete equipment configurations
   - **Files Modified**: EquipmentSpellsStep.tsx to use comprehensive equipment data
   - **Files Created**: `/frontend/src/data/classFeatures.ts` with D&D 5e class features
   - **Files Modified**: AbilityScoresStep.tsx validation logic fixes
   - **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Starting equipment selection now available for all classes
   - **Commits**: e2e1af3, 7a7472f pushed to main
8. ✅ Complete ALL D&D 5e Subclass Features Implementation
   - **Scope**: Systematic implementation of complete subclass feature progressions for all 12 D&D classes
   - **Total Coverage**: 119 subclasses with complete feature progressions
   - **Implementation Series** (commits c9e808e through c1151de):
     * Fighter (11 subclasses) - levels 3, 7, 10, 15, 18
     * Wizard (16 subclasses) - levels 2, 6, 10, 14
     * Rogue (10 subclasses) - levels 3, 9, 13, 17
     * Cleric (16 subclasses) - levels 1, 2, 6, 8, 17
     * Barbarian (7 subclasses) - levels 3, 6, 10, 14
     * Bard (9 subclasses) - levels 3, 6, 14
     * Ranger (8 subclasses) - levels 3, 7, 11, 15
     * Paladin (8 subclasses) - levels 3, 7, 15, 20
     * Druid (8 subclasses) - levels 2, 6, 10, 14
     * Monk (9 subclasses) - levels 3, 6, 11, 17
     * Sorcerer (10 subclasses) - levels 1, 6, 14, 18

   - **Files Modified**: `/api/src/lib/subclasses.ts` (4,635 lines)
   - **API Integration**: Subclasses served through `/api/classes/{className}` endpoint
   - **Deployment**: Successfully deployed to production (Version ID: 5f61f540-2632-4bd0-8431-4f0603def910)
   - **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - All 119 D&D 5e subclasses with complete feature progressions
   - **Verified**: Hexblade Warlock (levels 1, 6, 10, 14) confirmed working in production API
9. ✅ Fix Ability Score Assignment Bug in Character Wizard
   - **User Report**: Ability scores not registering when assigned to abilities in Standard Array interface
   - **Symptoms**: UI showed "you have all six abilities to have scores assigned to" even after assignments
   - **Investigation**: Located bug in StandardArrayInterface.tsx `assignScore` function (line 79)
   - **Root Cause**: Incorrect guard condition `!availableScores.includes(score) && !assignments[ability]`
     * Was blocking valid assignments when score was available AND ability had no prior assignment
     * Logic was inverted - prevented assignments instead of allowing them
   - **Fix**: Corrected guard condition to `!availableScores.includes(score) && assignments[ability] !== score`
     * Now properly allows assignments when score is in available pool
     * Only blocks when score is unavailable AND ability doesn't have that exact score
   - **Files Changed**: `/frontend/src/components/character-creation/StandardArrayInterface.tsx`
   - **Impact**:
     * Users can now successfully assign scores from standard array to abilities
     * "Assigned X/6" counter updates correctly
     * Both drag-and-drop and click-to-assign work as intended
   - **Deployment**: Successfully deployed to production (commit a23c943)
   - **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Ability score assignment now functional in Standard Array interface
