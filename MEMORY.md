# Project Memory - D&D Character Manager

## Current Session Context (2025-09-22)

### Authentication & Deployment Status
- ✅ Wrangler authentication completed (john@leefamilysso.com)
- ✅ Cloudflare accounts available: CyberMattLee, LLC & personal account
- ✅ Project ready for deployment to Cloudflare Workers/Pages

### Configuration Updates
- ✅ CLAUDE.md enhanced with mandatory agent usage policy
- ✅ Comprehensive Wrangler command reference added
- ✅ Project memory management system established

### Project Structure Overview
- **Frontend**: `/frontend/` - React + TypeScript + Vite
- **API**: `/api/` - Cloudflare Workers + Hono + TypeScript
- **Database**: D1 SQLite with migrations in `/database/`
- **Infrastructure**: Cloudflare Pages + Workers deployment

### Development Environment
- **Production-only development policy** enforced
- Frontend URL: https://dnd.cyberlees.dev
- API URL: https://dnd-character-manager-api-dev.cybermattlee-llc.workers.dev/api
- Local development servers prohibited per CLAUDE.md

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Agent Usage**: Mandatory specialized agent usage for all applicable tasks
2. **Memory System**: Project memory tracking implemented for session continuity
3. **Wrangler Integration**: Complete command reference documented for deployment operations
4. **Security**: JWT secrets to be managed via Wrangler secrets (not in config files)

### Current Sprint Status
Based on PROJECT-PLAN.md analysis:
- **Sprint 1**: Foundation & Security (Weeks 1-2) - IN PROGRESS
- Focus on critical security fixes and development environment setup
- Wrangler authentication completed as part of Day 5-6 objectives

### ✅ COMPLETED THIS SESSION
1. ✅ Deploy API to development environment
   - API successfully deployed to: https://dnd-character-manager-api-dev.cybermattlee-llc.workers.dev
   - Health check passing: Database and KV storage operational
2. ✅ Set up JWT secrets via Wrangler
   - JWT secrets configured for development, staging, and production environments
3. ✅ Verify frontend-API integration
   - Frontend correctly configured to use deployed API
   - API service layer properly set up with authentication interceptors
4. ✅ Install and configure GitHub CLI
   - GitHub CLI installed via Homebrew
   - Authenticated with TheRealTwoBowShow account
   - Token-based authentication configured
5. ✅ Resolve GitHub Issue #1 - Character Wizard Navigation Bug
   - **Root Cause**: Two-tier navigation system inconsistency
