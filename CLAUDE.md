# Claude Configuration

## Agent Preference
ALWAYS prefer using specialized agents over direct implementation when available. Agents are optimized for specific tasks and provide better results.

Available agents include:
- general-purpose: Complex research and multi-step tasks
- frontend-developer: React components, UI implementation
- typescript-pro: Advanced TypeScript patterns
- ui-ux-designer: Interface design and user experience
- deployment-engineer: CI/CD and infrastructure
- architect-review: Code architecture review
- data-scientist: Data analysis and SQL queries
- api-documenter: API documentation and specs
- test-automator: Test suites and automation
- code-reviewer: Code quality review
- backend-architect: API and system design

## Model Configuration
Use Sonnet (claude-sonnet-4) as the primary model for main tasks and complex reasoning.
